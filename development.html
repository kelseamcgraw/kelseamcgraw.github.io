  <h1>My Development Journey</h1>
  <h2>An Unexpected Start</h2>
  <p>
    I wouldn't say my development journey is anything that I expected to happen.
    I didn't create an app as a child. I didn't grow up dreaming of building custom
    software. Honestly, I didn't even apply to college intending to study software
    engineering.
  </p>
  <p>
    I grew up with plans to go to medical school. My entire life, my family members
    and teachers noticed my interest and proficiency in math and science courses.
    They told me, "You should be a doctor!" Naturally, I took this advice from those
    who guided me through my childhood. I read anatomy books for fun at 10 years old,
    shadowed anesthesiologists and orthopedic surgeons at 14, and applied to pre-medical
    programs at colleges across the Midwest at 17. I ended up at Miami University (OH)
    as a Biology major with a Pre-Medical Studies co-major.
  </p>
  <p>
    I decided to fulfill a variety of my liberal arts requirements during my first semester
    at Miami. One of these courses was CSE 174, "Introduction to Programming and Problem
    Solving." I figured it wouldn't hurt to learn the basics of such a valuable skill,
    and took a leap of faith into subject matter I had never seen before. My first day
    in class, I downloaded my first development environment and wrote my first "Hello World"
    program. As the semester continued, I was repeatedly impressed by what I was able to
    create, even though the course only consisted of the simplest Java assignments.
    By the end of the 15 week semester, I took on an optional project to create a game,
    and was dealing with graphics programming and game logic within my first few weeks
    of programming.
  </p>
  <h2>Pursuing a New Dream</h2>
  <p>
    During the winter of my freshman year, I worked with my advisor to change my major
    to software engineering. I fell in love with coding and realized I was taking
    advantage of an opportunity that would allow me to solve problems and continue
    learning throughout my professional career. My coursework became more focused on
    fine-tuning my technical skills. During my sophomore year, I participated on
    a team with a graduate student and faculty member at Miami. The graduate student's
    thesis work, <i>Realization of a Machine Learning Domain Specific Modeling Language:
    A Baseball Analytics Case Study</i>, was published in MODELSWARD 2019. I was
    responsible for appying different testing and QA approaches to the graduate
    student's code in order to test its robustness and consistency. I then contributed
    to the paper itself with my findings from my work.
  </p>
  <p>
    The summer following my sophomore year, I started my first co-op with Gaslight LLC,
    a custom software consultancy company. Gaslight is an Agile shop, consulting daily
    with their clients and delivering value frequently in small, manageable chunks.
    I fell in love with the Agile web development process and discovered it was something
    I'd be passionate about doing professionally long-term. During that summer of 2018,
    I worked on a team with three other interns to revitalize an internal application
    for Gaslight, which helped with scheduling teams on projects, managing invoicing,
    and analyzing business trends. My work on that project was my first experience
    with full-stack programming and my first introduction to Ruby on Rails and Javascript.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before the summer ended, I was invited back to co-op again in summer 2019. I took a
    short break from Gaslight to return to Oxford, OH for my junior year. While there,
    I heard about an opportunity to join a local company that was looking for an intern
    to work on their website while they developed their mobile app. I joined Cash Flow
    Solutions, Inc. for the fall semester to work on improving their API, making their
    site more user-friendly, and improving the design of the site. I worked on the
    private side of the site that their customers could see once logging in, and worked
    in ASP.NET for the backend.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, in the summer of 2019, I am back at Gaslight. I am working full time in
    my second co-op. I am Gaslight's only co-op this summer, and am lucky enough to be
    working on a development team with an experienced designer and two other experienced
    developers. We are working on the second phase of an engagement with a multi-million
    dollar lawn care company. We are building this client a breaking-edge tool that
    will assist other lawn care companies and change the nature of the business. The
    stack includes Ruby on Rails and React.
  </p>
  <h2>Planning for the Future</h2>
  <p>
    In order to best prepare myself for a future in web development, I am taking
    advantage of opportunities that come my way, while also actively seeking ways to
    better myself and my skills. I am thankful and excited to share that my second
    co-op with Gaslight has been extended throughout the fall semester! I am excited to
    continue working with Gaslight through the school year as I work part time to
    further develop my skills. During this time, I will be taking 5 courses and continuing
    my side job trading in the foreign exchange market.
  </p>
  <p>
    I will graduate from Miami University in May 2020 with my B.S. degree in software
    engineering. After graduation, I hope to earn a full time job with a company whose
    values align with my own.
