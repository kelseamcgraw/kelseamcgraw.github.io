    I am a 21 year old from a suburb west of Cleveland, Ohio. I currently reside
    in Cincinnati, Ohio as I complete my second co-op downtown with Gaslight LLC.

    I am currently working to complete my degree from Miami University. I expect
    to graduate in May 2020 with a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering. At
    Miami, I am a member of Engineers Without Borders, ACM-W, and MU Dropouts,
    Miami's skydiving club.
